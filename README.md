# Welcome to my GitHub Page!

I am someone who is learning for fun and to contribute to open source projects. Hopefully you can use something I have made or I have contributed to for your benifit.

## For Programmers

**All of My Work is Free to Use!**

Please use anything I have made, practiced on, or posted to your benifit. Everything I will ever make will be FOSS (Free and Open Source) and open to the public for use.

## Current Projects

I was inspired by a pomodoro CLI I found on the suckless.org website to create a broader, clean, and working timer and study terminal program solely on the CLI. Link for the original project below.
